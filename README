Task dispatcher to launch a list of serial tasks on a reserved
chunk of resources through the Torque task manager library.

COMPILATION

make <configuration>

Available configurations: fedora  (for Fedora desktops with Torque RPMs,
                                   and Temple's Owl's Nest 2 HPC cluster)
                          owlsnest (for Temple's Owl's Nest HPC cluster)


RUNNING

torque-launch <tasklist file>

The file will be processed line by line skipping over empty lines
and lines with comments. Comments are prefixed by a pound sign '#'.
The torque-launch command will distribute the individual tasks to
the reserved CPU slots on the individual nodes of the Torque job
and launch new tasks for as long as idle slots are available. The
tasklist can contain (many) more tasks than Torque reservertion
holds CPU slots. In this case the program will wait until a slot
becomes available through a previous task finishing. The individual
tasks are launched by passing the line of test to "/bin/sh -c";
the shell will switch to the current working directory of the
torque-launch command before executing a task.
